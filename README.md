# HCVP Rental Listings

This displays the Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8) apartments that the Chattanooga Housing Authority knows about.

The data source is [this Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/spreadsheets/d/10daWmhJnvckLq0v8HE5LsAlEotgG34H_9JQR0TLkPuo) which can be updated by CHA employees.

## Installation

First you'll want to `git clone` the repo and then `cd` into the `cha-hcvp-listings` folder.

You'll need Node and npm for this installation. Once you're in the project folder, just run `npm install` to make sure all the dependencies are installed and handled.

Once that's done, you can just run `npm start` which will spin up a development server with live reloading at [http://127.0.0.1:9966](http://127.0.0.1:9966).

Now you can make changes to `index.html`, `styles.css`, or `app.js` and it should be reflected in your browser window.
